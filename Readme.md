## Drools-EInst

Drools-EInst is a library of specifications for electronic institutions written for the [JBoss Drools](http://www.drools.org/) rule engine. Each specification provides a module for programmatic access to the relevant state of the institution.

The specifications in this library follow a framework, as specified in Sam Macbeth's thesis, which allows the conversion of Event Calculus specifications into ones compatible with Drools, and for the representation of institutionalised power, permission and obligation within an institution.

Current modules include:
* Institutionalised Power
* Access Control
* Micro Payments
* Provision and Appropriation
* Voting protocol
