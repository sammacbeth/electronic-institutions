## Drools-EInst

This is an implementation of a framework for the management of electronic institutions largely based off the formalisation done by Pitt, Schaumeier and Artikis (Pitt, J., Schaumeier, J. & Artikis, A. (2012), "Axiomatization of Socio-Economic Principles for Self-Organizing Institutions", _ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems 7(4), 1â€“39._). It is a modular implementation using JBoss Drools as an event processing engine, and with a set of Java APIs for sending events and reading the state of the institution.
